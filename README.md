## Expo CLI Quickstart

Assuming that you have [Node 10 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater installed, you can use `npm` to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```bash
$ npm install --global expo-cli
# or shorthand
$ npm i -g expo-cli
```

Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

```bash
expo init AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start
```

This will start a development server for you.
